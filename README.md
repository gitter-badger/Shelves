## Getting Started

Not going to lie here, there's not much to 'get started' with! If you want to help
with development, see the 'Contributing' section. 

## Disclaimer

> Shelves is still in the extremely early stages of development.
> There's not much to see, but as time goes on, more will be added.

> Just a word of warning, this should _not_ be run in production!
